# Figma-To-React
Pixel Perfect, Vite TS

I had this Figma file so i tried to make it pixel perfect.
1st i made the layout and made sure everything moves properly with mobile screen and then i added elements
Nav, and form basicaly, i used ReactIcons for icons and variables for main colors in CSS as per style sheet
